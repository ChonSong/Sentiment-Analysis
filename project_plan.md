## 1. Project Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Systematic Evaluation**: Conduct a comprehensive comparison of traditional and modern deep learning architectures for sentiment and emotion analysis on large-scale social media data
2. **Performance Analysis**: Quantify the performance differences between baseline models (RNN, LSTM, GRU, CNN-1D) and advanced models (BiLSTM, Transformer-based)
3. **Error Analysis**: Identify specific types of social media content that challenge current models
4. **Practical Insights**: Provide actionable recommendations for model selection based on performance-efficiency trade-offs

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Multilingual Assessment**: Evaluate model performance across different languages
2. **Scalability Analysis**: Assess computational requirements and training efficiency
3. **Robustness Testing**: Examine model resilience to noisy and informal text
4. **Reproducibility**: Create a comprehensive framework for future research

## 2. Research Questions

### RQ1: Performance Comparison
**Question**: How do traditional deep learning architectures (RNN, LSTM, GRU, CNN-1D) compare to advanced architectures (BiLSTM, Transformer-based models) in terms of accuracy, macro-F1 score, and computational efficiency on large-scale social media sentiment and emotion analysis?

**Sub-questions**:
- What is the magnitude of performance improvement from baseline to advanced models?
- Which model achieves the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency?
- How do models perform differently on sentiment vs. emotion classification tasks?

### RQ2: Content-Specific Challenges
**Question**: What specific types of social media content (e.g., sarcastic posts, multilingual text, slang-heavy content, emoji-rich text) pose the greatest challenges for different model architectures?

**Sub-questions**:
- Which linguistic phenomena cause the most classification errors?
- Do different architectures fail on different types of content?
- How does model performance vary across different social media platforms?

### RQ3: Multilingual Performance
**Question**: How do model architectures perform across different languages, and what are the implications for multilingual sentiment analysis systems?

**Sub-questions**:
- Which models show the best cross-lingual transfer capabilities?
- How significant is the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages?
- What preprocessing strategies are most effective for multilingual content?

### RQ4: Scalability and Deployment
**Question**: What are the practical considerations for deploying these models in real-world applications, considering factors like training time, inference speed, and memory requirements?

**Sub-questions**:
- What are the computational trade-offs between different architectures?
- Which models are most suitable for real-time processing?
- How do model compression techniques affect performance?

## 3. Hypotheses

### H1: Performance Hierarchy
**Hypothesis**: Transformer-based models (DistilBERT) will achieve the highest performance (accuracy and macro-F1), followed by BiLSTM, then traditional RNNs (LSTM > GRU > RNN), with CNN-1D showing competitive but inconsistent performance.

**Rationale**: Transformer architectures have shown superior performance on various NLP tasks due to their attention mechanisms and pre-training. BiLSTMs capture bidirectional context better than unidirectional models.

### H2: Content-Specific Vulnerabilities
**Hypothesis**: Traditional models will struggle more with sarcasm and context-dependent sentiment, while all models will face challenges with code-switching and heavy slang usage. Transformer models will show better robustness to these challenges.

**Rationale**: Transformers' attention mechanisms should better capture long-range dependencies and contextual nuances required for understanding sarcasm and complex linguistic patterns.

### H3: Multilingual Performance Gap
**Hypothesis**: Performance will be significantly lower for non-English content, with the gap being smallest for Transformer-based models due to their multilingual pre-training.

**Rationale**: Most models are primarily trained on English data, creating a bias. Multilingual transformers like mBERT-based models should show better cross-lingual performance.

### H4: Efficiency Trade-offs
**Hypothesis**: There will be a clear trade-off between model performance and computational efficiency, with CNNs being most efficient, RNNs moderately efficient, and Transformers least efficient but most accurate.

**Rationale**: Transformer models require significantly more computational resources due to their attention mechanisms and larger parameter counts.
